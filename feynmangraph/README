FG is a tcl/tk -based application for drawing
Feynman diagrams for publishing purposes.
It was written by I.Musatov, with help from V.Serov.



INSTALLATION 

FG is a tcl/tk -based program, so it does need Tcl and Tk
to be installed on your computer. Tcl and Tk are free
distributed packages available for most Unix
platforms, and usually are included in basic system
configurations. For information on how to obtain
and install tcl/tk see, e.g., http://www.tcltk.com.

This distribution includes file diag.dia with a few sample
diagrams.


GETTING STARTED

After you have successfully started FG, you may try to
draw some objects, using the menu button "Draw Line" or
"Draw Arc". To draw a line, choose the type of the line from
menu, mark the starting point by clicking left mouse button
(" <1> "), drag the cursor to the ending point, and then
release the button. The red line shows the position where
the line is going to be placed. To actually create it, press
the right mouse button ( <3> ), to cancel drawing press
the middle button ( <2> ), or to redraw the line, just start
drawing with a new starting point.

Drawing arcs is a little bit different. After fixing starting
and ending points in the way you draw the line in "Draw Line"
mode, you will see marks on these points, some auxulary line and
a round coursor in the middle of the line. Moving the coursor
with <1>, you can set the height of the arc. Then <3> will draw
the actual arc line, and again, <2> cancels the "Draw Arc" mode.

In general, FG reports what it is doing in the right lower
corner of the window borders.

TEXT

The "Text" menu allows to put some text into the diagram.
Before starting new text, you may choose the font.
Note, that this option is in some way computer dependent,
so if the X-server font set on your computer does not coinside
with that used by FG, some fonts may be disabled. See "ADVANCED"
for how to correct the problem.

To put text, choose "Create Text" and mark with <1> the position of
the left upper corner of the future text object. Then the text
coursor appears and you may start typing. Text can be multi-line, and
there are some editing features. Again, <2> cancels the mode and <3>
fixes the object, but <1> will move the text coursor only inside
the new text.

EDITING

The only things you can do to the objects other than text are to
move, copy or remove. Anyway, it would be easier to create a new
line than to alter the old one. So, if you click <1> on an object,
it becomes "Marked" or "Selected" (on color monitors it also changes
color). Now, dragging mouse with <1> pressed ( <Motion-1> ) will
move the object to a new position, <2> will remove and <3> will
fix it.

Note, that any selected object is immediately copied into internal
buffer and replaces any old buffer's content.

It is possible to mark all objects in some area, so that they can
be moved or copied as a whole. To create an area, mark its corner
with simultaneously pressing "Shift" key on the keyboard and right
button on the mouse ( <Shift-3> ) and then extend it with <Motion-3>.
When the area is created, you can mark objects inside it with <3>,
cancel with <2>, or you may start it over again with <Shift-3>.
Now the marked objects can be moved together by dragging any of
them (or the frame of the area) with <Motion-1> or removed with
<2>, and <3> will fix all the objects.

To paste content of the  buffer, press "Shift" key on the keyboard
and left mouse button ( <Shift-1> ). Objects appear "marked",
so they can be moved, deleted or fixed as described before.

Texts can be handled in the same way. The only difference is that it
is possible to edit the text itself. To start editing text, click <1>
on it twice. This invokes a text editor, with some funny features
(sorry, I have not programmed moving the text coursor across lines
by vertical arrows, so please use horisontal arrows or mouse
instead). Exactly as when creating text, <2> cancels the mode and <3>
fixes the object, but <1> will move the text coursor only inside
the text.


FILES

The functions "Load Diagram" and "Save", as well as "Create PS", are
almost obvious. "Load Picture" allows to include a .gif image into
a diagram.

It is possible to create or edit a number of diagrams at a time in the
same FG program. All diagrams will be stored into a single file by the
"Save" (or "Save as...") operation. Also, "Load Diagram" will load all
the diagrams from the file, replacing in memory diagrams with the same
numbers. To see the new diagram instead of the old one, use "Window - 
Show Loaded". To see the full list of existing diagrams, use
"File - List of Diagrams" (see "List of Diagrams"). 

This FG version does not check that the changes are saved, so DO NOT FORGET
to SAVE a diagram after having edited it. Also, if you say "File - Save"
for some diagram, not only the diagramm in that (current) window will be saved,
but also all existing diagrams will be stored to the same file.

"File - Create PS" creates ps-file of the picture in the current window,
with the size and layout of the page exactly as those of the window.
So, before creating PS, adjust position of the diagram in the window
and the size.


WINDOW

There are two ways to open a new window: from menu "Window - New Window",
and from the box "List of Diagrams". The diagram number in the current
window or comment can be changed with button "Diagram # .."
(See "Diagram Number").
"File - Update Current" or "Save" will copy current picture to memory,
and "Window - Show Loaded" shows in the current window the diagram
with corresponding number as it exists in memory.


DIAGRAM NUMBER and COMMENT

Pressing button "Diagram #" in the lower left corner of the
window border enters the dialog, which allows to change the
current diagram number and to enter a string of commentary.


LIST OF DIAGRAMS

The "List of Diagrams" box shows the list of existing diagrams
under their nimbers, with comments and with date and time of last
update. The lines in the box can be marked with <1>.
The line "New Diagram" is to give the opportunity to open a new
window for a new diagram.
