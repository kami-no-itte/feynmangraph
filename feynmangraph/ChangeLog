1.04-beta2
	Line color editor is added

1.04-beta    

	Bug fixes.

	The status line with status of "Font", "Snap to Grid" and
	"Grid Step" options added.

	Text fonts are defined for each window (not global).

	The size of the diagram window is saved to .dia file, so
	that when the diagram loaded, the window is restored to
        its original size.

	W-boson line added.

	Two new types of the "Paste from buffer" feature added:
	vertical ( <Control-1> ) and horisontal ( <Alt-Shift-1> )
	mirror reflections. 

	"Grid" and "Snap to Grid" features are implemented. 

	The diagram is updated in memory on every change in the
	window, so "Update" function in the "File" menu
	is obsolete. The "List of Diagrams" shows status of each
	diagram in the first column: "-" - loaded from a file,
	"*" - changed but not saved.

	Special algorithms were added to search for the file
	which contains the blob filling pattern. Should improve
	portability of the files with saved diagrams.

	KDE integration elements are available.

	Starting from 1.04-alpha, FeynmanGraph is distributed
	under the terms and conditions of the General Public License 
	(see http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)
	
1.03

	$db(InstallDir) is used to look for config, gray.pm files.
	This should allow some portability for .dia files.


1.02

	FG is modified so that it can run from any (not necessary
	its install location) directory.
	However, no install script provided at this time.
	To install it by hands, one should follow rather simple 
	instructions which can be found in the file INSTALL.chg
	in this distribution.

	The module fg.tcl takes now one optional argument, the diagram
	file name, which will be loaded at start if exists.


1.01

	Minor bugs fixed.
