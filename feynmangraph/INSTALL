If you install FG from tar-distribution, the folowing should be done to make it work:

1. Untar the archive

1. Copy the all files from FG-1.xx/ to the desired location (e.g.,
   to /usr/share/FG/ ).
2. Edit the file FG (or Fg): change the path to the fg.tcl file
   so that it points to your FG install directory.
3. In the file fg.tcl, edit the line

        set dir /usr/share/FG/

   so that the "dir" variable set to the FG install directory.
4. Put executable FG (or link to it) in a place where it can be found
   in the PATH (e.g., /usr/local/bin).
